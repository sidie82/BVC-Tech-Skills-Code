# About We-Vote

The main scope of our project is to create a database that will contain the different voting statistics in 2017 using the sources mentioned above. Target users for this database are running candidates for Mayor, Councillor and School Board Trustees in 2021 election and thereafter, nevertheless, any individual looking into analyzing voting statistics in 2017 are identified potential users as well. This database will help users 1) analyze voter turnouts 2) to identify political leaning (left, center left, center, center right and right) of different demographics such as income, age, percentage of voters with families, education, ethnicity, gender and unemployment rate. Furthermore, to voter turnouts, data would be looked into from polling stations by wards. Ward boundaries used would be as per Calgary election site but will be updated accordingly when new ward boundaries will be released in January 2021. From here, stations and communities that are most active are identified by taking the percentage of eligible voters with the percentage of those who voted. Advanced voting turnout vs regular voting turn out would also be looked into
